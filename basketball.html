<h1><span style="color: #800000;">BASKETBALL</span></h1>
<p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in North America. It was invented by a Canadian physical education teacher in 1891. Basketball was conceived as a safe sport compared to the more physical sports like football. Basketball is also one of the cheaper sports to play as players don't need the expensive equipment that is required for many other sports.</p>
<h3><strong>LONDON LIGHTNING</strong></h3>
<p>The NBLC (National Basketball League of Canada) is a small league with just 4 teams, all of which are in Ontario and 3 of which are in Southern Ontario. The local team, London Lightning, is based here in London and play at the Budweiser Gardens - the same arena in which the Knights hockey team plays.</p>
<p>The Lightning have won the NBLC championship both in 2022 and 2023 and now have 6 championships in total!</p>
